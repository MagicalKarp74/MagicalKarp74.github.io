            <h3><li> Playstation 2: 158m sold</h3></li>
        <h4><p> The ps2, coming out in the year 2000, is the best selling game console of all time, this was because of multiple factors such as good price, first console to come out for the 6th console gen, and it also working as a dvd player!</p></h4>
        <hr>

        <h2><li> Nintendo Ds: 154m sold</li></h2>
        <h4><p> The ds came out in 2004 and sold so well because it appealed to more casual audiences, as it could be used to do math, reading, among other things rather than just video games. While originally not selling well, the release of the ds lite turned it around because of its lighter, smaller, sleeker design.</p></h4>
        <i>This console kind of cheats since this counts amount sold of all 3 iterations of the ds (og ds, ds lite and dsi)</i>
        <hr>

        <h3 id = "exception"><li> Nintendo Switch: 140m sold</li></h3>
        <h4><p> While not even at the end of its life cycle, the Nintendo switch has already made it to the number 3 spot. Coming out in 2016, the nintendo switch was a huge success as it was one of the first home consoles that could also be used portably! </p></h4>
